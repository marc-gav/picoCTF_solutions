This challenge asks you to execute ARM assembly code. The complexity of the problem is that in most cases people's computers run on x86_64 processors. This leaves you with two options:
1. Translate the code to x86_64 assembly and run it on your computer.
2. Compile the ARM assembly code for an ARM capable machine and run it there.

Luckily for us, Docker is an absolute beast of a tool and allows us to do run option 2 on a x86_64 machine. The following Dockerfile will do the trick:

```Dockerfile
FROM arm64v8/debian:latest

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y gcc
COPY ./chall.S .
RUN gcc -o chall chall.S
CMD [ "./chall", "4004594377", "4110761777"]
```

The Dockerfile will create a container based on the `arm64v8/debian:latest` image, install gcc, copy the assembly code to the container, compile it and run it with the two arguments provided by the challenge.

We build this and then run it using `docker run --platform linux/arm64/v8 -i [container_name]` and get the flag as an integer. The last step is to convert it to hexadecimal and insert it into the flag format `picoCTF{[flag]}`.

The last tiny trick I have used is the following:

```bash
result=$(echo "obase=16; $result" | bc | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
echo 'picoCTF{'$result'}'
```

1. `echo "obase=16; $result` converts the result to hexadecimal but doesn't print the result. It just declares the operation to be done. In this case the operation is: read result and convert it to hexadecimal.
2. `bc` is the utility that reads `obase=16; $result` and executes it. It then prints the result of the operation to `stdout`.
3. Finally we need to convert the hexadecimal to lowercase and wrap it in the flag format. This is done by `tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'` and `echo 'picoCTF{'$result'}'`.
